# Risk of Rain 2 Run Data

## Overview
This project reads your Risk of Rain 2 run history by parsing the xml files the game saves to your hard drive. The parsed data is then stored onto the database that it was used to create. The database is updated with your most recent runs each time the parser is run.

## Settings
- The directory path to your run reports. Please replace this with the relavent path on your machine.
- The date of your most recent run. This is updated upon running the parser if there is a new run (according to the date on file).
